==============

A kata I've made from our hiring process technical challenge.

== Challenge ==
Write a simple application that allows virtual machines to be distributed within a server farm. The application can be written in any language.

The solution must at least:

Distribute virtual machines on the servers in the most balanced way possible.
- Receive as parameters the number of available servers and the number of virtual machines to distribute.
- Handle the fact that each server has a different number of units available for virtual machines.
- Handle the fact that each virtual machine uses up a different number of units.
